# Low Latency C++ Learning Project
This is my own implementation of project from book [Building Low Latency Applications with C++](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Building-Low-Latency-Applications-with-CPP). I'm building that to practice and understand LL C++ patterns. 

The difference between the book and my version is usage of Windows. I'm building the project on Windows 10 with VC++23 (not sure if I'll add any 23's features)
